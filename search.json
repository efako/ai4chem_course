Experience in Python programming and machine learning (ML) will help you to get up to speed quickly, but we will try to make it as accessible as possible.\nWe will make use of Google Colab to run the code directly in your browser, as there is zero configuration required and we will have access to GPUs free of charge.\nA lot of the examples and ideas in this course are taken from the open-source community, which we will properly reference.",
